  team: "The Neon Runner game was developed by a team of 5 talented developers: Vivi, Carlos, Pierre, Diego, and one mysterious contributor. They worked together for months, building the game from scratch.",
  culprit: "After investigating the git history, a pattern emerges. All the breaking commits trace back to one developer. But who is this saboteur?",
  sabotage: "The bugs weren't accidents - they were deliberate. Someone sabotaged the coin rendering, enemy speeds, scoring system, and more. Each change broke something critical.",
  evidence: "By examining the commits in detail, you can see the saboteur's strategy: subtle changes to game mechanics that looked innocent but completely broke gameplay. But their identity remains hidden.",
  secretMessage: "A secret message was hidden in the repository - in the most unexpected place. Finding it reveals the culprit's real name: Alfredo. The clues were there all along, hidden in plain sight.",
  tension: "Why would Alfredo do this? Looking at the commit timeline and team communications, it becomes clear: he felt overlooked and undervalued by the team despite his contributions.",
  resolution: "Through Git investigation, you've uncovered the whole story. By reverting his sabotage commits and discovering his hidden message, the game is fixed. The team now understands what happened and can address the real issue - making everyone feel valued."
